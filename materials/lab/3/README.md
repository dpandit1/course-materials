I went with the option 2. I added one more parameter for search i.e. minify(boolean) in addition with the query and page number. Minify basically asks the user if he/she wants to truncate the larger fields or not? And along with the ports, IP and location, I have added an extra longitude and latitude info. The page number and minify request is asked to the user when the program runs and based on their answer the search command will operate.
